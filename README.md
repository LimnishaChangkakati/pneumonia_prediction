# pneumonia_prediction
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, the model classifies images as either "Normal" or "Pneumonia" with high accuracy, helping support faster and more accessible preliminary diagnosis.
